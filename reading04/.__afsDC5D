% Overview --------------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{Overview}

\paragraph{
I used shell scripts and Gnuplots to analyze the gender and ethnicity data
of the students in Notre Dame's Computer Science program.  Plotting this data
from the classes of 2013 through 2019 as provided by Ramzi Bualuan of the 
Computer Science department, I was able to identify norms and trends in
diversity in the program.  The program has increased in size every year since
2014, and the students in the progrma have been and are largely Caucasian and
male.  While there have generally been more female students each year than in
the previous, they are still outnumbered by their male peers nearly two to
one, and while there has been a slight increase in the number of 
non-Caucasian students, there are still far more Caucasian students in the
program than students of other ethnicities.

% Methodology -----------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{Methodology}

\paragraph{
To process the {\tt demographics.csv} data I used the two shell scripts 
printed below, gender.sh and ethnic.sh, that function similarly.  Each script
relies on a function that takes two input arguments; the count\_gender 
function in gender.sh takes the year and the gender to be totaled.  With 
these, it sets the column to search based on the year because the data in the
provided .csv if organized in columns by year.  It then uses the gender 
argument to determine what character to count in that column.  These 
variables are then used in the pipeline at the end of the function.  curl 
downloads the data from the specified URL, cut takes the specified column 
based on the comma delimiter, grep finds all lines in that column matching 
the specified gender, and wc -l lists the number of lines in that output, 
counting the number of matches.  This outputs the number of students of the 
specified gender in the specified year.  This pipeline runs in the for loop 
at the bottom of the script, calculating the number of students of each 
gender in each year present in the data and using echo to output this data in
the form of (year) (# of female students) (# of male students).  ethnic.sh 
functions in exactly the same way, but instead of taking gender as the 
second argument of its count\_ethnic function, it takes ethnicity as
represented by the characters C, O, S, B, N, T, and U.  The function uses
these characters in a pieline identical to that used in the gender.sh script
to generate totals for students of each ethnicities in each year.  This 
function is run in the for loop at the bottom of the script for each
ethnicity each year, producing output in the for of the year followed by 
the number of students of each ethnicity in the data.
\par
To produce the graphs in Figures {\ref fig:gender }and {\ref fig:ethnic}, I first
ran the gender.sh and ethnic.sh scripts to store the information from the 
demographics csv in tables in gender.dat and ethnic.dat.  This data can be 
seen in Tables {\ref tbl:gender} and {\ref tbl:ethnic}.  I then used these .dat
files and the provided .plt files and Makefile to plot the demographics data
in the gender.png and ethnic.png files.
\par
I did not have too much difficulty extracting data or plotting it 
because of how much of the necessary code was provided in the Reading04 
assignment.  One aspect that I did struggle with was writing the arithmetic
expression to determine the column based on the year.  I was trying to use
the expr command, but it was not compatible with the way in which I was
formatting my expression.  I was able to use the arithmetic expression
\$(( )) notation instead to solve this problem.

% TODO: REMOVE and EDIT
This briefly describes how you processed the {\tt demographics.csv} data and
how you produced the graphs. In particular, it should discuss any interesting
or frustrating problems you faced and how you overcame them. You may include
\href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Source_Code_Listings}{code listings}
of your shell scripts if you wish (as long as you provide some description to
accompany the code).

% TODO: REMOVE and EDIT
This should provide tables that summarize the {\tt demographics.csv} data and
graphs that provide insight into the questions:

% TODO: INSERT FIGURE

\begin{enumerate}

\item{}What is the overall trend in gender balance in the Computer Science and
    Engineering program at the University of Notre Dame?

\item{}How has ethnic diversity changed over time in the Computer Science and
    Engineering program at the University of Notre Dame?

\end{enumerate}

% TODO: INSERT FIGURE

You should accompany these tables and graphs with some commentary on the
meaning of the data and plots.

% Discussion ------------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{Discussion}

\paragraph{}

% TODO: REMOVE and EDIT
This final section is an opportunity for you to reflect on the issue of
creating a {\bf welcoming} and {\bf supportive} learning environment at the
University of Notre Dame. For instance, you may wish to discuss any of the
following questions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{}Are the issues of gender and ethnic diversity important to you? Should
    the department work to increase diversity? Should the technology industry
    	try to improve workplace diversity? Why or why not?

\item{}Does the Computer Science and Engineering department provide a welcoming
    and supportive learning environment to all students? In what ways can it
    	improve?

\item{}What challenges have you experienced thus far in the Computer Science
    and Engineering program? How could the department or university better
    	support you?

\end{enumerate}
